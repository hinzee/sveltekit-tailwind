# Sveltekit Tailwind

This project is a modern web application built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). SvelteKit offers a seamless developer experience with efficient bundling and optimized performance. Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, allowing for rapid UI development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

## Installation

To set up the project for development, you'll need to install the dependencies using `pnpm`, a fast and disk space efficient package manager.

If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally via `npm`:

    npm install -g pnpm

## Setting Up the Project

Once `pnpm` is installed, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/hinzee/sveltekit-tailwind

    # Navigate into the project directory
    cd sveltekit-tailwind

    # Install dependencies
    pnpm i

## Development

To start the development server, run:

    pnpm dev

This will start the local server for development, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Additional Commands

- `pnpm build` - Build the production-ready version of the app.
- `pnpm preview` - Preview the built app.
